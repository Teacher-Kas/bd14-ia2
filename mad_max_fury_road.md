#Mad Max Fury Road

Max and Furiosa fight off the Rock Rider's as Joe's car, with Nux now on board, surmounts the blockade and eventually 
attacks Furiosa's truck, allowing Nux to board. However, as the truck escapes, 
Angharad falls off in an 
attempt to protect Max and is run over by Joe's car, 
mortally wounding her and her child.
